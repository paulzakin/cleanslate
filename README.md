## Do I need to host Clean Slate to use it?

Nope!

We maintain a free instance at [cleanslate.sh](https://cleanslate.sh). It offers free accounts with social login. For example, "Login with Google".

## How is Clean Slate licensed?

Clean Slate is licensed under Apache 2.0 and is open source!

## How do I host Clean Slate?

Hosting Clean Slate is easy. You just need a Linux server with Git, Docker, and Docker Compose installed.

1.  Run `git clone https://github.com/successible/cleanslate` on your server. `cd` inside the newly created folder called `cleanslate`.

2.  Create a `.env` file in the `cleanslate` folder. Replace `<>` with your values.

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-desired-password>
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_DOMAIN=<your-server-domain>
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=<long-secret-value>
```

3.  Have your reverse proxy point to `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:8080`. For example, you could use `Caddy` and the `Caddyfile` below, replacing `<XXX>` with your own domain. You could also use `nginx`, `apache`, etc. However, Clean Slate must be served over `https`. Otherwise, it will not work. We just recommend Caddy [^1] because it handles `https` automatically and is easy to use [^2].

Here is an example `Caddyfile`. Replace `<XXX>` with your own domain.

```bash
<XXX> {
  header {
    Referrer-Policy "strict-origin"
    Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains;"
    X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block;"
  }
  route /v1* {
    # API (Hasura)
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }
  route /v2* {
    # API (Hasura)
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }
  route /console* {
    # Admin panel (Hasura)
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }
  route /healthz {
    # Health check (Hasura)
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }
  route /* {
    # Static files (Clean Slate)
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000

    header {
      # You can remove the Google, Firebase, and Sentry policies if you are not using them
      Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' blob: data:; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com https://www.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.ingest.sentry.io https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://apis.google.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.firebaseapp.com https://www.google.com; img-src 'self' https://www.gstatic.com data:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://fonts.googleapis.com; worker-src 'self';"
      Permissions-Policy "accelerometer=(self), autoplay=(self), camera=(self), cross-origin-isolated=(self), display-capture=(self), encrypted-media=(self), fullscreen=(self), geolocation=(self), gyroscope=(self), keyboard-map=(self), magnetometer=(self), microphone=(self), midi=(self), payment=(self), picture-in-picture=(self), publickey-credentials-get=(self), screen-wake-lock=(self), sync-xhr=(self), usb=(self), xr-spatial-tracking=(self)"
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example `nginx.conf`. Replace `<XXX>` with your own content.

> Note: With `nginx`, you will need to get your own SSL certificate.

```bash
error_log /dev/stdout crit;
http {
  server {
      listen 443 http2 ssl;
      listen [::]:443 http2 ssl;
      server_name <XXX>;

      ssl_certificate <XXX>
      ssl_certificate_key <XXX>;

      # HTTP Security Headers
      add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin";
      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains;";
      add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
      add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
      add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block;";

      location /v1 {
        # API (Hasura)
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'Upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      }

      location /v2 {
          # API (Hasura)
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      }

      location /console {
          # Admin panel (Hasura)
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      }

      location /healthz {
          # Health check (Hasura)
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
      }

      location / {
          # Static files (Clean Slate)
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;

          # You can remove the Google, Firebase, and Sentry policies if you are not using them
          add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' blob: data:; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com https://www.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.ingest.sentry.io https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://apis.google.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.firebaseapp.com https://www.google.com; img-src 'self' https://www.gstatic.com data:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://fonts.googleapis.com; worker-src 'self';"
          add_header Permissions-Policy "accelerometer=(self), autoplay=(self), camera=(self), cross-origin-isolated=(self), display-capture=(self), encrypted-media=(self), fullscreen=(self), geolocation=(self), gyroscope=(self), keyboard-map=(self), magnetometer=(self), microphone=(self), midi=(self), payment=(self), picture-in-picture=(self), publickey-credentials-get=(self), screen-wake-lock=(self), sync-xhr=(self), usb=(self), xr-spatial-tracking=(self)"
      }
  }
}
```

4.  Run `git pull origin main; bash deploy.sh`. This script will build and start three servers on `localhost` via Docker Compose. One, the database (PostgreSQL). Two, the client (React via busybox). Three, the server (Hasura).

> Note: Clean Slate uses the default `postgres` user and `postgres` database. It runs this database, Postgres 15, on port `5432` via Docker Compose. If you do not like this behavior, you must create your own `docker-compose.yml`. Then, run `export COMPOSE_FILE=<your-custom-file.yml>; git pull origin main; bash deploy.sh`

5.  Go to the `https://<your-domain>/console`. Log in with your `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` defined in your `.env`. Click `Data`, then `public`, then `profiles`, then `Insert Row`. On this screen, click `Save`. This will create a new Profile. Click to `Browse Rows`. Take note of the `authId` of the row you just made. That is your (very long) password to log in.

6.  You can now log in to `https://<your-domain>` with that password.

7.  To deploy the newest version of Clean Slate, run `git pull origin main; bash deploy.sh` again. Before you deploy, read `CHANGELOG.md`. We will list any breaking changes that have occurred.

## How do I handle authentication in Clean Slate?

### Default: Authentication via authId

Clean Slate was built around delegating authentication to Firebase. Firebase is a very secure authentication service maintained by Google. It is our default recommendation for any instance of Clean Slate with more than a few users. Consult the `Using Firebase` section (below) for how to set up Firebase with Clean Slate.

However, Firebase is too complex for the most common hosting scenario. That is a privacy-focused user who wants to host Clean Slate for their personal use. Hence, our default authentication system, `authId`, is much simpler. There is no username or password and no need for your server to send email. Instead, we use very long tokens (uuid4) stored as plain text in the `authId` column in the database. Because each token is very long and generated randomly, they are very secure. And if you ever need to change the value of the `authId`, you can just use the Hasura Console. If you would rather not use the `authId` system, you will need to use Firebase instead.

### Optional: Authentication via Firebase

- Create a new Firebase project.
- Enable Firebase authentication.
- Enable the Google provider in Firebase.
- Create your `.firebaserc` locally in the root with the following content. Example:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "<your-firebase-project-name>"
  }
}
```

- Create a `firebase-config.json` locally filled with the content of `firebaseConfig`. You can find that on your Project Settings page on Firebase.

```json
{
  "apiKey": "<XXX>",
  "appId": "<XXX>",
  "authDomain": "<XXX>",
  "messagingSenderId": "<XXX>",
  "projectId": "<XXX>",
  "storageBucket": "<XXX>"
}
```

- Login with Firebase locally via `npx firebase login`.
- Run `npx firebase deploy --only functions`. This will deploy Firebase functions in `/functions`.

You can now run Firebase locally or in production with these last steps.

Locally (Linux or Mac):

- Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- Mac only: Install and use GNU [sed](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-sed)
- Run `export FIREBASE='true'; npm run dev`

Production (Linux):

- Add these items to your `.env` as outlined below. Replace `<XXX>` with your own values. You can find your project config in your Firebase project settings. Do not add these values unless you are doing authentication via Firebase.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG='{"apiKey":"<XXX>","appId":"<XXX>","authDomain":"<XXX>","messagingSenderId":"<XXX>","projectId":"<XXX>","storageBucket":"<XXX>"}'
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGIN_WITH_APPLE='true'
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGIN_WITH_FACEBOOK='true'
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGIN_WITH_GITHUB='true'
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE='true'
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE='false'
HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET='{ "type": "RS256", "audience": "<XXX>", "issuer": "https://securetoken.google.com/<XXX>", "jwk_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com" }'
```

## How do I contribute to Clean Slate?

Run Clean Slate locally, make changes, and then submit a pull request on GitHub!

> Note: Clean Slate is written in [React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) as the framework. It uses [Hasura](https://hasura.io) as the backend and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the database.

Here is how to run Clean Slate locally:

- Install the following and make sure Docker Desktop is running:

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install).
  - [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/commands/hasura_console/)
  - [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

- Run `pnpm dev` after cloning down the repository. This will spin up these servers:

  - Hasura (API): `http://localhost:8080`.
  - Hasura (Console): `http://localhost:9695`.
  - Next.js: `http://localhost:3000`.
  - PostgreSQL: `http://localhost:1270`

- Navigate to `https://localhost` and login with token `22140ebd-0d06-46cd-8d44-aff5cb7e7101`.

> Note: To test the deployment process, run `git pull origin main; bash deploy.sh`. Make sure to create the `.env` (below) and `Caddyfile` (above) first.

> Note: To test Clean Slate on a mobile device, install `ngrok`. Run `ngrok http --host-header localhost https://localhost:443` in another terminal.

```bash
# .env for testing the hosting process locally. Do not use in an actual production setting!
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=XXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_DOMAIN=localhost
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=XXX
HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET='{ "type": "HS256", "key": "XXX" }'
```
